# Go Game Collection 🎮

Welcome to the **Go Game Collection** repository! Here, you'll find four engaging games developed in the Go programming language: **Hangman**, **Pong**, **Snake**, and **Zombie Attack**. This project is an exciting way to learn and practice Go, combining fundamentals of game development with fun and interactive gameplay.

## Games Overview 🕹️

1. **Hangman**  
   The classic word-guessing game. Try to guess the hidden word letter by letter before the figure is "hanged." This game will test your vocabulary and deduction skills!

2. **Pong**  
   A retro-style table tennis game. Control the paddle and bounce the ball back and forth to keep the rally going as long as possible. Great for practicing timing and precision!

3. **Snake**  
   Navigate the snake to eat food and grow longer without colliding with the wall or its own body. This game will challenge your reflexes and spatial awareness.

4. **Zombie Attack**  
   A survival game where you must fend off incoming waves of zombies. Each level gets more challenging as zombies increase in speed and numbers. How long can you survive?

## Installation 🛠️

Follow these steps to get started:

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Moaz007Malik/Started-Learning-Go-Lang.git
   cd Started-Learning-Go-Lang
   ```

2. **Install Go**  
   Make sure you have Go installed on your system. If not, download and install it from [the official Go website](https://golang.org/dl/).

3. **Run each game**  
   Navigate to the folder for each game and run it directly from the terminal.  
   ```bash
   go run <game_folder>/<game_name>.go
   ```
   - Replace `<game_folder>` with the folder name (e.g., `hangman`) and `<game_name>.go` with the main Go file for each game.

## Gameplay Instructions 📜

- **Hangman**: Use the keyboard to guess letters. Each incorrect guess brings the figure closer to hanging!
- **Pong**: Control the paddle using the arrow keys or "A" and "D" keys.
- **Snake**: Steer the snake with arrow keys. The snake grows longer with each food item it eats.
- **Zombie Attack**: Move your character with arrow keys, and use the space bar to attack incoming zombies.

## Screenshots & Previews 📸

_(Screenshots of each game can be added here once available!)_

## Technologies Used 💻

- **Go Language**: Core language used for game logic and development.
- **Basic Graphics**: ASCII art and terminal output for game visuals. Future updates may include graphical upgrades.

## Getting Started 🚀

To start exploring the Go Game Collection, follow these additional tips:

1. **Explore Each Game Folder**  
   Each game is housed in its own folder, containing the main Go file and any additional resources or helper files required for the game.

2. **Run the Games Individually**  
   Navigate to each game’s folder and run it from the terminal using the following command:
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```
   - Be sure to replace `main.go` with the actual file name for each game if they differ.

3. **Experiment with Code**  
   Feel free to modify the code in each game to add new features or tweak game mechanics. It’s a great way to practice Go programming and customize the games to your liking!

## Game Structure 🏗️

Each game folder generally follows this structure:

```
/<game_name>
├── main.go          # Main file where the game logic is implemented
├── assets/          # Optional folder for any assets (e.g., images, sounds)
└── README.md        # Game-specific instructions (optional)
```

This setup keeps each game self-contained, making it easy to manage and update each one independently.

## Future Updates 🚀

This project is an ongoing journey! Future enhancements may include:
- Adding a GUI for each game using Go GUI libraries
- Implementing scoring systems and leaderboards
- Increasing difficulty levels with more complex gameplay mechanics

Stay tuned for more exciting updates!
